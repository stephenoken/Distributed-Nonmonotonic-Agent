\module{CGI Tool} %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

   \label{CGIUser}

   The program {\tt Defeasible.cgi} is a Common Gateway
   Interface program which provides a world wide web 
   interface to \deimos. The program should be
   accessed with a WWW browser with the URL:
   {\tt http://your.www.site/Defeasible.cgi}.

   \noindent For our WWW site, this is: \\
   {\tt \href{http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/~arock/defeasible/Defeasible.cgi}{http://www.cit.gu.edu.au/\twiddle arock/defeasible/Defeasible.cgi}}   

   This opens the starting page for the system, containing
   pointers to information about Defeasible logic
   and \deimos. A form allows the user to select an example
   Defeasible theory to work with, or to open a page
   where a new theory can be entered.
   
   With a theory selected or entered, the user can enter
   queries in the form of tagged literals. The form for
   entry of the queries has a menu that selects the prover
   to use. The choices available are equivalent to those
   offered by {\tt ODProver} and summarized
   in table~\ref{flatHistProversTable}.
   
   The CGI tool is stateless. All information about a session
   is maintained within the HTML data returned to the
   user's browser.
